# Plan 0015 — Private ChatGPT and Privy setup

**Status:** in progress; implementation verified locally, production deployment pending.
**Date:** 2026-10-06.
**Branch:** fix/wallet-signin-diagnostics.
**Base:** b55a47651c81ed8a1134f00deaeabc9b6cc4d792.

## Owner direction

Josh explicitly chose a private tool, fully autonomous execution, and a Privy
wallet. He already has a Privy app and is completing its security checklist.
This resumes the direction in [design 0017](../design/0017-a-private-autonomous-trader.md)
and [plan 0011](0011-private-autonomous-trader.md). It supplies neither the app
identifier nor a wallet, delegation, capital mandate or inference allowance.
Those remain unset; no real trade is authorized by this increment.

## This increment

- Classify wallet exceptions by code: only 4001 is cancellation. Preserve
  technical failures and their stage, allow retry, reject malformed responses,
  and detect Solflare's namespaced provider. Display feedback below the button.
- Add the operator-only `/automation` page, reached by **Private setup** in the
  terminal. It connects ChatGPT, reports Privy app configuration, and states
  that autonomous execution is not connected. `/ask` contains only chat.
- Allow subscription linking with a configured CLI before an inference budget
  exists. Inference stays unavailable without its existing budget and ledger.
- Put CSP, X-Frame-Options and nosniff on the application's embedded responses.
  Privy's required wallet origins and Turnstile are allowed; framing Radar and
  inline/eval scripts remain forbidden. The Caddy example no longer sets a
  second CSP. Inline styles are allowed for the wallet UI.
  HTTPS metadata fetches and images preserve the existing creator-hosted token
  pictures; their content remains untrusted data.
- Update the vulnerable source-map-js build dependency without upgrading the
  Solana signing library across a major version.

## Evidence

The working tree's `just web` passed 343 tests, audit at the existing high
severity gate, type-check and build. `just site` passed 79 tests, audit,
type-check and build after the same source-map-js patch in its lockfile.
`cargo +stable-x86_64-pc-windows-gnullvm test -p radar-serve --lib --test chat_route --test access_guard`
and the repo-conformance tests passed, as did scoped clippy with warnings denied.
The mobile-width setup page was inspected in the browser and its overflowing
connect button corrected. These checks are local, not live-trading evidence.

Reversing the wallet rejection comparison failed four regressions. Requiring a
chat instance before subscription linking failed the new route regression;
restoring the fix passed all five chat-route tests. Plumbing and static copy are not
mutation subjects; CI owns the wider mutation gate.
Removing the application frame header failed the CSP/header regression.

Live inspection on 2026-10-06 returned build
`a4d24f7f1db0a7bdb2a9ef271b2981e8dfc087a1`, `agent.configured=false`,
`trading=true`, `policyClosed=true`. The environment had no Privy app or model
provider setting. `codex-cli 0.131.0` is installed and the radar-agent user
exists, but the isolated wrapper was absent. Public HTML returned neither CSP
nor X-Frame-Options. A Caddy example file containing headers was not evidence
that the public response carried them.

## Next actions

1. Finish validation, open the PR, let required CI finish, then build and deploy
   through the established artifact/hash and radar-deploy procedure. Verify
   the live build and public HTML headers before marking Privy's checkboxes.
2. Obtain the public Privy app ID and dedicated Solana wallet ID. Configure
   application credentials securely on the server; keep the authorization key
   only in the separate signer. Do not put secrets in chat or the web bundle.
3. Install the isolated Codex wrapper per the deploy guide and set
   RADAR_MODEL_CODEX. The owner completes the browser sign-in. Choose an
   inference allowance separately, then verify an evidence-backed model call.
4. Resume plan 0011's portfolio reconciliation, durable operations, proposal to
   risk-kernel adapter, Privy signing and execution supervisor. Connect typed
   recommendations to deterministic validation, never parse chat prose into
   transactions. Exercise the complete lane with stubs before a live canary.
5. Obtain principal, position/trade, loss, asset, inference and session bounds
   before enabling unattended own-money execution. Leave Policy::CLOSED intact.

## Handback

**Stopped at:** final verification and release preparation for the connection
and diagnostics increment. ChatGPT and Privy are not connected in production;
no autonomous trading loop has been enabled.
**Next action:** read this branch's test results and finish step 1, then use the
owner's Privy identifiers and limits to start steps 2–5.
**Do not:** claim a wallet is delegated from an app ID, treat connected ChatGPT
as capital authority, expose the private site, copy existing subscription
credentials between hosts, invent money limits, or turn on automated trading.
